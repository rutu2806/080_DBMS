1) Assume each salesperson has a 12% commission. Write a query on the orders
table that will produce the order number, the salesperson number, and the amount
of the salesperson’s commission for that order.
--> SELECT  ONUM, SNUM, AMT, (12/100)*AMT '12% COMM' FROM ORDERS;


2) Write a query on the Customers table that will find the highest rating in each city.
Put the output in this form:
 For the city (city), the highest rating is : (rating).
--> SELECT  CITY, MAX(RATING) FROM CUSTOMERS GROUP BY CITY;


3) Write a query that lists customers in descending order of rating. Output the rating
field first, followed by the customer’s name and number.
--> SELECT RATING, CNAME, CNUM FROM CUSTOMERS ORDER BY RATING DESC;


4) Write a query that totals the orders for each day and places the results in
descending order.
--> SELECT COUNT(ODATE) AS TOTAL_ORDER, ODATE FROM ORDERS GROUP BY ODATE ORDER BY TOTAL_ORDER DESC ;
